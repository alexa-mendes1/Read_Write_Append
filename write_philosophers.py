# Exercise:
# This program writes three lines of data
# to a file.
def main():

# Open a file named philosophers.txt.
    outfile = open('philosophers.txt', 'w')

# Write the names of three philosphers to the file –
# John Locke, David Hume and Edmund Burke
    outfile.write("John Locke\n")
    outfile.write("David Hume\n")
    outfile.write("Edmund Burke\n")

# Close the file.
    outfile.close()

# Call the main function.
